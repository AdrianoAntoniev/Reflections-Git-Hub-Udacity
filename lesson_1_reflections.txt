How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It help me so much, because now I don't need to sweep around the all code to find any bug!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Through some version controls like Dropbox, Wikipedia, Google docs etc

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	
	Git provides a offline access and any text editors


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In order to improve the productivity.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	I use the command log in order to see all the commits made, and the command diff <prev_id, desired_id> in order
	to see what the file are changed between the both commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	With Git, I can, in any case of crash code, "undo", say, turn back to a previous version
.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	
	I can't wait for manage my projects!
