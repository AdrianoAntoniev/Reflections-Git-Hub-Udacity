1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I need to have a backup or I want to share my project

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It is true. But sometimes I can need make this kind of thing. 

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork: get a copy of the someone's project for my Github page
	clone: get a project from the git (of mine or not) to my computer
	branch: create copies of the snapshot of the projett in my computer.

	(fork) when I want to get a project of someone inside of github
	(clone) when I want to modify a project of someone in my computer
	(branch) when I want to edit something in a project w/o affect the entire project (in my own machine)

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Sometimes I need to turn back to the version previous.

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder
	I don't mind. GitHub is very easy to use and robust
