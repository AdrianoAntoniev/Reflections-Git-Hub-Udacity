1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When i initialize a repository, there is no commit yet. 

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    When I need to do a modification that is diferent from the context of the project

5)How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

6)What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	I can make several features beside the master branch, and after testing, I can merge it with the master branch

7)What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	With git i can get conflict areas more easily
