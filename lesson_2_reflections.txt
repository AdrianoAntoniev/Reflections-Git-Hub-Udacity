REFLECTIONS-------------------------------------------------------------

1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When i initialize a repository, there is no commit yet. 

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	I believe that the staging area is an intermediate area. It is very important because it seeks any change in a file putted in itself
